Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
NO the three model architecture didn't classify the bread of Malinois_01.jpg to be the same bread:
AlexNet: Malinois_01.jpg: 
Real:                   malinois   Classifier:                       leonberg  
ResNet: Malinois_01.jpg: 
Real:                   malinois   Classifier:                       malinois 
Vgg: Malinois_01.jpg: 
Real:                   malinois   Classifier:                       malinois  

AlexNet Failed in the classificatiion task hence it wasn't able to classify malinois breed correctly,whereas 
Vgg and Resnet did well on clasifying the first image correctly.

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: NO the three model architectures didn't classify the breed of dog in Malinois_01.jpg to be the same bread as they classified Beagle_02.jpg
AlexNet:Beagle_02.jpg: 
Real:                     beagle   Classifier:                         beagle
ResNet:Beagle_02.jpg: 
Real:                     beagle   Classifier:                         beagle 
Vgg:Beagle_02.jpg: 
Real:                     beagle   Classifier:  walker hound, walker foxhound


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, the three model architectures correctly classify eagle_01.jpg and Cube.jpg to not be dogs
4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:

The three model architectures did equally well on classifying Not Dog Image, But on the classification task of Dog Images ResNet performed the best 
since it classified correctly both dog's breed.
